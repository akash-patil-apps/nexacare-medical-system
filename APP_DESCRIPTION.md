# NexaCare Medical System - App Description

## Short Description for AI/Explanations

**NexaCare** is a comprehensive full-stack healthcare management platform that digitizes the entire patient journey from appointment booking to prescription management. Built with React, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL, the system connects six distinct user roles—patients, doctors, receptionists, hospital admins, lab technicians, and system administrators—through a seamless, real-time workflow. Patients can search hospitals by city, browse doctors by specialty, and book appointments with intelligent slot availability (showing green/yellow/red indicators for booking capacity). Receptionists confirm pending appointments and check in walk-in patients, while doctors manage their daily schedules, view comprehensive patient histories, and create digital prescriptions that instantly appear in patient dashboards. The platform features role-specific dashboards with KPI cards, appointment filtering, prescription management, lab report integration, and cross-tab synchronization using React Query and localStorage events. Walk-in registration allows receptionists to register new patients with OTP verification and immediately book appointments, while the appointment status flow (pending → confirmed → checked-in → completed) keeps all stakeholders synchronized. The system includes priority-based appointment booking, color-coded time slot availability, comprehensive patient information drawers, and a responsive design that works seamlessly on mobile and desktop. With 341+ test users across all roles, NexaCare demonstrates a complete end-to-end healthcare workflow from patient onboarding through appointment completion, prescription delivery, and medical record management.
